In this project, I analyzed a movie dataset, focusing on data preprocessing and data visualization. The goal was to clean and transform the raw data for analysis and generate insightful visualizations to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset. Tools used include Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
